# Playwright

Welcome to the Playwright Demo Project!

This repository contains a demonstration project showcasing the usage of Playwright, a powerful browser automation library, along with TypeScript. This is my first project using Playwright and TypeScript, so it may undergo improvements and enhancements over time.

## About the Project

Used website: https://demo-bank.vercel.app/
The purpose of this project is to provide practical examples of how to utilize Playwright for browser automation and testing.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `test-data`: Contains test data used in the automated tests.
- `pages`: Includes page object classes that abstract the interactions with specific pages.
- `components`: Contains components that might be used in different pages.
- `tests`: Holds the automated test scripts using Playwright and TypeScript.

## Inspiration and contributing

This is a learning experiment, and contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions for improvements, bug fixes, or additional features, please feel free to submit a pull request or create an issue.

## Future Improvements

As a beginner project with Playwright and TypeScript, this repository will be continuously improved. Expect updates to enhance the project structure, include more advanced test scenarios, and demonstrate best practices in browser automation testing using Playwright and Typescript.

Feel free to explore the project.
